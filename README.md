# NTDOA Research: Grid Costs and Nelder-Mead Costs

This repository contains my research on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA)-based signal source localization.  
The project explores grid-based cost functions and Nelder-Mead optimization for accurate source localization under a known signal speed.

## Key Features
- Implements TDOA with known speed of signal
- Grid-based and Nelder-Mead cost function comparison
- Evaluation using synthetic datasets

## Results
The code successfully estimates source locations under homogeneous environment
